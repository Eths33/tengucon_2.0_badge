# Tengucon 2.0 Badge Case

Simple case for the Tengucon 2.0 badge.

I printed in PLA with support material, see included images for more info.

Also, I used ```Support Material → XY Separation Between Object and Support 150%``` for easy support removal.

## Hardware Notes

There is an optional friction fit 3D printable screw to connect the board at the top. Depending on your printer settings you may need to scale the screw as the tolerances are intended to be very small.

This build initially used the following parts only because they were on hand; they are **not** specifically recommended:
